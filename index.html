          <p>Hello, world!(cliched much?). My name is Anthony. I have been a machinist in the aerospace industry for 9 years. I have
experience using G-code in a CNC related field for machine programming and managing program files for machining systems.
I have rudimentary grasp of JavaScript. At the current moment I have completed several introductory MOOCs on HTML5, CSS3 and Python.
I am reliable, hard working and self-motivated but one of my best attributes is that I have a unquenchable thirst for more knowledge even for the mundane. One of my favorite quotes goes as such, "If you are the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room."</p>

      <article class="goals">
        <h3 class="journey">What Brought Me Here</h3>
        <p>The thought of creating something that is uniquely yours but is abstract and open to others influence to make something that moves and inspires them has always been an interest of mine. Web design and development was always an interesting take and seemed like a logical pursuit in that direction. I hope to become a full stack developer and take this artistic hobby and turn it into something constructive, beautiful and maybe just maybe a new career where my dreams and desire can be my livelihood.</p>
        <p>In the meantime I plan on immersing myself into each particular aspect of the process. Passion is uncovered through work and action so by doing what I want to do, I'll discover what I want to do. It sounds lofty and ludicrous I know but what noble pursuits have ever started reasonably attainable. So I'm official out of my comfort zone and if you'd like come along for the ride.</p>
